excerpt: "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation.Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles.
