excerpt: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) poses a promising paradigm to learn useful behaviors
  in a
  task-agnostic environment without the guidance of extrinsic rewards to facilitate the fast
  adaptation of various downstream tasks. Previous works focused on the pre-training in a
  model-free
  manner while lacking the study of transition dynamics modeling that leaves a large space for the
  improvement of sample efficiency in downstream tasks.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
