excerpt: "To address the challenge of the exponential growth of the joint action space and the resulting exponential increase in search space, this paper extends the AlphaZero and MuZero algorithms to more complex multi-agent Markov decision processes, proposing two algorithms, Multiagent Gumbel AlphaZero and Multiagent Gumbel MuZero. These algorithms are based on resettable environment simulators and multi-agent world models constructed by neural networks, enabling efficient search and decision-making. An efficient without-replacement top-$k$ sampling algorithm is proposed for exponential action space, along with a high-quality policy improvement operator adapted to it, reducing the complexity and computational burden of Monte Carlo tree search while enhancing exploration capabilities. Besides, we propose a Centralized Planning with Decentralized Execution (CPDE) paradigm which uses centralized planning to accelerate policy learning while enabling decentralized execution for deployment. The algorithms achieve the best performance in testing environments such as StarCraft compared to model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, with a 10-fold increase in learning sample efficiency while maintaining win rates."
